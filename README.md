## To-do
 - Emojis picker: since all emojis are not supported, there should an emoji picker that shows all supported emojis.
 - Better UI: current UI is just for testing, so a better UI should be made.
 - Done: ~~Improve URL checking system: I know, the current system looks awful that's why it will be changed.~~

## Disclaimer
This app uses Google Keyboard emoji kitchen API and all emojis generated in the app are by Google.
